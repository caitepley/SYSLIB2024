# Using the Nano Text Editor

### Main Ideas
Nano is a text editor for plain text. 
Plain text is information in the basic form of text only (NO images). 
A text editor is used to create and edit these plain text files. 
If you want to format the content that is in a plain text file, you can add something like HTML tags, which the text editor can store, but it won't actually do anything with them.
To actually show the HTML formatting stored in a plain text file, you will have to display the file in a browser, not the text editor. I am interested to see how creating HTML documents in nano compares to 
creating them in Notepad or VSCode (carving an HTML document into a stone tablet would be preferred to using Notepad IMO).

### Configure `nano` 
I spent a bit of time trying to get the ##.nanorc## file set up so I could copy the the setup code from the class notes onto my VM system. I referenced this outside source to create 
the .nanorc file: [Configuring Nano Text Editor with nanorc](https://linuxhint.com/configure_nano_text_editor_nanorc/).

I used the commands `touch ~/.nanorc` to create the file and `nano ~/.nanorc` to open it. Once I was actually able to create the file, copy-pasting the code block from the class notes was pretty straightforward.

### Using Nano
I have some experience using VIM (my physics advisor tried to get me to write all of my Python scripts in VIM, and I will never do it again as VSCode has spoiled me). However, I have not really used Nano or
anything else. So far, I am liking Nano; the options are pretty straightforward and it's convenient that all of the commands are listed at the bottom.
