### Installing Bat
to search for the `bat` application, I first used the command `apt search bat` to see what all packages exist with 'bat' in the name. I then used `apt show bat` to see a summary of the application to see if it was what I was meaning to install.
Once I confirmed that is was what I wanted, I ran `sudo apt install bat` and installed the package. 

Once the package was installed, the command `batcat example.txt` was used to create this output:

This is pretty cool because it shows file contents (like the `cat` command) but with the formatting and line numbers you would see if you opened the file in a text editor.
