# What I Have Learned

I have used markdown before to write READMEs for coding assignments and projects, but I've never really messed with the formatting, so I learned a lot this week.

### Bold Text

To type in **bold**, add **two** asterisk symbols (**) before and after the section of text that you would like to put in bold (it can be a single word, or several consecutive words).

### Italics

To type in *italics*, add **one** asterisk symbol (*) before and after the section of text that you would like to put in italics (like bold text, it can be a single word, or several consecutive words).

### Combining Bold and Italics

To type in both **bold** and *italics* ***at the same time***, add **three** asterisk symbols (***) before 
and after the section of text that you would like to put in italics (like bold and italic text, it can be a single word, or several consecutive words).

### Code

To distinguish a small amount of code, like a linux command, use the backtick symbol before and after the code snippet. 
Example: `git clone`. The backtick symbol looks like ( ` ).

### Code Blocks

To distinguish a larger amound of code, like a block, use three backtick symbols before and after the code block. 
Example:
```
  for i in range(10):
    print('Hello, LIS690!')
```

### Numbered Lists

To create a numbered (or ordered) list, type (1.), type what you want the first element of the list to say, and then hit enter to go to the next element of the list.
Example: 

My favorite books:
1. The Stand by Stephen King
2. Summer of Night by Dan Simmons
3. The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires by Grady Hendrix

### Unordered Lists

To create an unordered list, type a dash (-), type what you want the first element of the list to say, and then hit enter to go to the next element of the list.
Example:

My Favorite Movies:
- Evil Dead 2
- Le Yeux Sans Visage
- What Have You Done to Solange?

### Links

To link to a webpage: [cool link](https://www.thingiverse.com/)

### Images

To add an image: ![My Dog](IMG_8575.jpg)

### Quotes

To add a quote:
> There is something at work in my soul, which I do not understand.
> -- Mary Shelley
