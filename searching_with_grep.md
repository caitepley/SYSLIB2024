Task: Create a new file in your GitHub repository. Use markdown formatting to write a page of example grep queries and notes as you examine your Scopus data. Be sure to post more than your queries. 
Write about the data, what each grep command that you create seeks to do, etc. That is, be descriptive and document your process, queries, intentions, etc. Post a link here to your GitHub repo, and 
discuss or raise any questions you have in our Element. If you're having problems with Element, let me know. It's required that you participate
there this week.

# Searching with grep

## Uploading Data
I could not get the scopus.bib file transferred using the command from the text/lecture, so I used the alternative method instead. I exported the data that I wanted from Scopus, added it to this git repo (under scopus.bib), 
and then used `wget` with the URL of the data on github. This worked great.
